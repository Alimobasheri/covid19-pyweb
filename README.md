# covid19-pyweb
A mini project to build a dashboard for analyzing and visualizing covid19 spread records.
This project will use python as the backend language which uses flask module to export the frontend.

The original idea comes from w3resource covid-19 python mini project.

The main data source is https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/raw/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_daily_reports. It's a good repository which gathers data daily, state and province based.

Currently the app is in development state and may not be completely functioning. If you have any ideas let me know. And you are welcome to contribute.

<b>Installation</b>:
If you don't have python installed, install python3.

This web app requires flask package for python to serve th webpage. You can install by pip.
<code>$ pip install flask</code>

The web app needs network connection and the only frontend required module (babeljs) is cdn based. 

<b>How to run</b>:
Clone this repository to your machine. In cmd redirect to the code base folder and type:
<code>$ python3 covid-19.py</code>

If ran successfully a message appears which says the app is running on http://127.0.0.1:5000. Enter this address in your browser and you should see the results. 

<p>More is coming. Wait!</p>
